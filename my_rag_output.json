This process is like lossy compression, where you lose some information but gain efficiency.  Think of it as squeezing a lot of data into a smaller space, but in this case, it's squeezing information about how to make predictions.  The more parameters you have, the more complex the network, and the more data you need to train it, which makes it expensive and time-consuming. Once the training is complete, using the network is relatively cheap and fast. \n",

Think of it like learning the alphabet and basic words before you can write a complete sentence. The next stage is fine-tuning, where they take that basic understanding and use it to create an \"assistant model.\" This means the AI learns to generate answers to questions rather than just writing documents.\n",

These parameters aren't found in the code itself but are obtained through a complex training process that's way more intense than just running the model on a computer.

        "answer": "Viewing large language models like operating systems suggests that, like operating systems, they could be highly customizable and capable of self-improvement, but this comes with some challenges. For example, it's difficult to determine whether the output of a large language model is good or bad, which makes it tricky to design a clear reward system for self-improvement. While self-improvement might be possible in specific, narrow domains, it's still an open question how to achieve it in a broader, more general sense. \n",

        "answer": "The Lama 270b model uses a process called \"lossy compression\" to condense a massive amount of internet text into a manageable size. It's like taking a giant file and squeezing it into a smaller \"zip file,\" but unlike a regular zip file, some information is lost in the process. This allows the model to learn from the vast amount of text without having to store the entire thing. It's a clever trick that uses a large number of powerful computers to condense a huge amount of data into a much smaller, but still informative, representation. \n",
        "contexts": [
            "of neural networks, you need about 600 gpus and you would run this for about 12 days to get a lama 270b and this would cost you about 2 million dollars and what this is doing is basically it is compressing this large chunk of text into what you can think of as a kind of a zip file so these parameters that i showed you in an earlier slide are best kind of thought of as like a zip file of the internet and in this case what would come out are these parameters 140 gb so you can see that the... compression ratio here is roughly like 100 x, roughly speaking, but this is not exactly a zip file because a zip file is lossless compression, what's happening here is a lossy compression, we're just kind of like getting a kind of a gastalt of the text that we trained on, we don't have an identical copy of it in these parameters and so it's kind of like a lossy compression, you can think about it that way. the one more thing to point out here is these numbers here are actually by today's standards"

Just like how we have proprietary operating systems like Windows and macOS and an open-source ecosystem with a diverse range of Linux-based operating systems, we see the same dynamic with large language models (LLMs).  Proprietary LLMs, like GPT series from OpenAI, PaLM series from Google, and LaMDA series from Google, are like the Windows and macOS of the LLM world. On the other hand, open-source LLMs, currently mostly based on the LLaMA series, are like the diverse Linux-based operating systems. This analogy helps us understand how the LLM ecosystem is developing, and we can potentially learn from the past experiences of operating systems to understand the future of LLMs. \n",
        "contexts": [
            "like this analogy of LLM's kind of of becoming a bit of an operating system ecosystem is that there are also some equivalence i think between the current operating systems and the and what's emerging today, so for example in the desktop operating system space we have a few proprietary operating systems like windows and mac os, but we also have this open source ecosystem of a large diversity of operating systems based on linux. in the same way here we have some proprietary operating systems like GPT series, clot series or bar series from google, but we also have a rapidly emerging and maturing ecosystem in open source, large language bottles, currently mostly based on the lama series, and so I think the analogy also holds for the for uh for this reason in terms of how the ecosystem is shaping up, and we can potentially borrow a lot of analogies from the previous computing stack to try to think about this new computing stack fundamentally based around large language models,"

        "answer": "AlphaGo, a program developed by DeepMind, initially learned by imitating human players, but it reached a plateau and couldn't surpass human experts. This is because it was limited by the quality of the data it was trained on. To overcome this limitation, AlphaGo employed self-improvement, which allowed it to surpass human performance in the game of Go.  Self-improvement involves a program continuously playing against itself, analyzing its mistakes, and refining its strategy. This process allows the program to learn and evolve at a much faster rate than if it were only learning from human data. This approach could potentially be applied to language models to address their challenges in reward evaluation. By playing against itself and learning from its mistakes, a language model could become better at evaluating the quality of its own output and making adjustments to improve its performance. \n",
        "contexts": [
            "thinking about, and the second example I wanted to give is this idea of self-improvement, so I think a lot of people are broadly inspired by what happened with AlphaGo, so in alpha go um, this was a go playing program developed by deepmind, and alpha go actually had two major stages, the first release of it did, in the first stage you learned by imitating human expert players, so you take lots of games that were played by humans, you kind of like just filter... to the games played by really good humans and you learn by imitation, you're getting the neural network to just imitate really good players and this works and this gives you a pretty good go playing program, but it can't surpass human, it's it's only as good as the best human that gives it the training data, so deep figured out the way to actually surpass humans and the way this was done is by self-improvement. now in a case of go, this is a simple closed sandbox environment, you have a game and you can play lots of... in the"
